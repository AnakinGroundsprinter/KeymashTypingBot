# KeymashTypingBot
This is a typing bot for the website keymash.io
It opens your browser, launches the keymash.io website and starts completing typing tests untill you stop the program.
The program will ask you to specify a link. This link is going to have to be the link of the exact competition of your choice and NOT the main keymash.io website.
Once the browser is launched and the bot has started typing, you may freely hide the tab and continue using your computer normally.
The numbers appearing in the terminal are the number of matches your bot has participated in.
You MUST close all your chrome services for the bot to work.
